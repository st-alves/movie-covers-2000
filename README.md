# Movie Covers (2001-2010)
Movie covers from the 2000's (2001-2010).

## ID
Use the IMDb movie ID without the initial "tt".

## How to use links
Use this URL pattern for default covers (you'll have to implement the automation yourself):
```python
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/st-alves/movie-covers-${decade}/refs/heads/main/${type}/${movie_id}.jpg"
```

Example: 
<br>```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/st-alves/movie-covers-2000/refs/heads/main/default/0121765.jpg```

Only "default" is available for ```${type}``` for now.
